- help vs performance
- break down by item and student
- students -> 
	- tooltips? 
	- brushing/ filtering (selecting) by school or class
- factors
	- Y: learning gains = pre-post scores difference
	- X(small multiples): # problems completed, # AP problems completed, % AP problems correct, % time on task vs off task vs idle

toggle: pre or post test
bars: 2 bars per question, %A correct and % B correct
small multiples: tablet vs paper condition vs table+paper combined
- select/deselect all toggle, click on each bar to toggle
- pre/post toggle (maybe unit toggle also) -> exclude kids who didn't do both pre and post test
- smaller dots/circles
- click on correct, incorrect or both bars to select which to view
	- clicking multiple bars means must fulfill ALL conditions

- future: maybe kids were doing a lot of easy problems
