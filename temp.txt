- help vs performance
- break down by item and student
- students -> 
	- tooltips? 
	- brushing/ filtering (selecting) by school or class
- factors
	- Y: learning gains = pre-post scores difference
	- X(small multiples): # problems completed, # AP problems completed, % AP problems correct, % time on task vs off task vs idle

toggle: pre unit 2 or post unit 2, pre unit 4, post unit 4
bars: 2 bars per question, %A correct and % B correct
color = if they did A or B (orange vs blue)
small multiples: tablet vs paper condition vs table+paper combined
- select/deselect all toggle, click on each bar to toggle (join over which questions)
- pre/post toggle (maybe unit toggle also) -> exclude kids who didn't do both pre and post test
- smaller dots/circles
- click on correct, incorrect or both bars to select which to view
	- clicking multiple bars means must fulfill ALL conditions

- future: maybe kids were doing a lot of easy problems

4/30 Issues

- occlusion on graph - changing dot sizes overlap shouldn't be happening much anyway bc looking at overall trends, if there is overlap it doesn't matter; also we can select just orange or just blue if that matters - maybe use outline vs filled circle?

- buttons shadow styling - look for pretty SVG  buttons
- where should interaction area be for bars
 - try different sensitivities for sensitive areas
	- black border on hover
	- expand bar?
	- dots under bars to show what is selected? - probably uniform 

- how large to make graphs
	- i.e. no longer care about conditions, show 6 graphs/ no longer care about A vs B
	- maybe separate graphs into 2 groups, divided by the problem bars
- keep bars horizontally aligned bc most screens are wider than taller
	- bars can be thinner and closer together
- do we care more about comparing A vs B tests or tablet vs paper? (not a priority for now) 
	 
- label for problem bars (% correct isn't quite accurate)
	- Correctness vs correct

- button toggles to select all A, all B, all correct, all incorrect 4 buttons

- animations between switching units: animate all dots at a time for now, can change later

- animate bars growing and shrinking between pre and post; animate bars fading in about between condition changes

- meaningful captions later


DONE 
- black dots! get rid
- EX - AP -> Exercise and Assessment
- axes intersect at the wrong place - how to label?
-  make axes stand out at the zeroes, lighter grey for label line, copy Tableau's dotted line and intersecting zeroes
- question number labels
- incorrect bar alignment issue
- clicking tiny bars??



After Nell is done:
- graph title
- change select button text based on whether we are doing A/B or tablet/paper
- toggle select/deselect?
- negative AP percentages??
